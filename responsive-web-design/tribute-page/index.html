            <p>Marie Skłodowska Curie was a Polish and naturalized-French physicist and chemist who conducted pioneering research on radioactivity. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first person and only woman to win the Nobel Prize twice, and the only person to win a Nobel Prize in two different scientific fields.</p>

                <li><strong>1891:</strong> Moved to Paris to attend the Sorbonne and pursue studies in physics and mathematics.</li>
                <li><strong>1893:</strong> Completed her master's degree in physics, ranked first in her class.</li>
                <li><strong>1894:</strong> Earned a second degree in mathematics from the Sorbonne. Met Pierre Curie, a French physicist. They married in 1895.</li>
                <li><strong>1896:</strong> Began research on uranium rays, inspired by Henri Becquerel's discovery of radioactivity.</li>
                <li><strong>1898:</strong> Discovered the elements polonium (named after her native Poland) and radium with Pierre Curie.</li>
                <li><strong>1903:</strong> Awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics along with Pierre Curie and Henri Becquerel for their work on radioactivity, making her the first woman to win a Nobel Prize.</li>
                <li><strong>1906:</strong> Pierre Curie died in a tragic accident. Marie Curie took over his teaching position at the Sorbonne, becoming the first woman to teach there.</li>
                <li><strong>1911:</strong> Awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for her discovery of radium and polonium, making her the first person to win Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields.</li>
                <li><strong>1914:</strong> Established the Radium Institute (now Curie Institute) in Paris, which became a major center for medical research.</li>
                <li><strong>1914-1918:</strong> During World War I, developed mobile radiography units, known as "Little Curies," to assist battlefield surgeons with X-ray equipment.</li>
                <li><strong>1920s:</strong> Continued her research and worked on promoting the use of radium for medical purposes. Made several international trips to raise funds for her research.</li>
                <li><strong>1934:</strong> Died on July 4 in Sancellemoz Sanatorium, France, from aplastic anemia, believed to be caused by prolonged exposure to radiation.</li>
